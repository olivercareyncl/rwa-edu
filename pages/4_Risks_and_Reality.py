### Key risks (plain English)
- **Custody & keys:** If you lose private keys, you lose access.
- **Smart contract bugs:** Code can contain flaws; audits reduce (not remove) risk.
- **Regulatory uncertainty:** Varies by country; tokens may be treated as securities.
- **Liquidity risk:** Tokens may not have a ready market; spreads can be wide.
- **Oracle risk:** Off‑chain data (e.g., rent payments) must be fed on‑chain reliably.

### Good practices
- Prefer **audited** protocols and transparent reporting.
- Separate **hot** (spending) and **cold** (savings) wallets.
- Start small; diversify; understand **how yield is generated**.
